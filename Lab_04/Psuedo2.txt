combineString
1. Starting from int main(), I declared both string word and int count.
2. Then inputs of word and count and its' respective print statments are written.
3. Call combineStr with parameters word and count.
4. Going to combineStr method, the parameters are str and int a.
5. If the count is 0, program ends. Other than that, it continues.
6. for loop from 0 to count leads it to the next line.
7. if the i did not reach the end of the count (count), then it would not print out the
answer.
8. when reached, program prints out answer. 

sortArray1
1. sortArr starts running with int arr x (array), int size, and int n (choice). Also, int
temp is declared.
2. Nested for loop for the upcoming selection sort.
3. if statement that has the conditions for ascending order and choice 0 is shown. If meet,
array will do ascending order.
4. Another if statement, but this is for descending order and choice 1.
5. Within both if statements, same selection algorithm is implemented. 

sortArray2
1. sortArr starts running with int arr x (array), int size, and int n (choice). Also, int
temp is declared.
2. for loop for the start of the insertion loop.
3. Declared temp equals to x[i], also int j equals i-1.
4. while loops for both conditions and its respective choices are performed.
5. Within the loops, standard insertion sort rules are applied.
6. the swap is complete by making x[j+1] = temp.

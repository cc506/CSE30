Pseudo Code


Array1.cpp

1.Initialize the array's varibales including size and the numbers of the array.

2.Print out the size of the arrray. With the input option.

3.Create a if statement in the condition where the size is less or equal to zero, a error
  statement will appear.

4.Print out the statement to enter the numbers of array by spaces, with input
ation.
5. Read elements of array by using for loop, then it is iterated.
6. If next number is bigger than the current number "This IS an increasing array" prints.
7. Else, "This is Not an increasing array" prints

Array2.cpp
1. Initialize character array and string.
2. Print out statement to enter string, inputed into string variable.
3. Declare int variable for length of string.
4. Use strcpy to convert the string within the char array.
5. for loop goes through the array backwards
6. String is printed out.

Array3.cpp
1. Initialize int size and store the user input into the variable.
2. if statement for size inputs that are out of bounce. If it is, error statement is
printed.
3. Initialize 2D array and count.
4. for loop for the row of the array is done. With my code,it is also used to loop the
row # in the print statement.
5. for loop for the column of the array runs. Using the nested loop, values have been
inputed in to the array.
6. If condition where if the specific value in the array is negative, count variable is
added by one.
7. Outside of the nested loop, the if conditions for the diffrent statements are
implemented. If the count equals 0, the non-negatives statements prints and vice versa.
